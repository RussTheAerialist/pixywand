An LED [Leviwand](https://flowtoys.com/flow-wand) that is motion reactive.

**work in progress**

## Hardware

* [MStickC](https://m5stack.com/products/stick-c)
* WS2812B leds
* 3d Printed Parts (look in the STL directory)
* NiMH AA Batteries (must be NiMH or NiCD because 1.2V)

## Software

* Compiles with PlatformIO Extension of VsCode
* [FastLED](http://fastled.io/)
* Arduino Framework

## Simulation

Check out the PixelVisualizer.html file. IMU data is output over BLE, but there is some recorded data points recorded from the actual device on the prototype.
